Risk Management in ML Systems

Machine learning systems introduce unique risks that require specialized management approaches.

Technical risks:
1. Model drift - Performance degradation over time
2. Data quality issues - Corrupt or biased input data
3. Adversarial attacks - Malicious attempts to fool models
4. System failures - Infrastructure and deployment issues
5. Privacy breaches - Unauthorized access to sensitive data

Business risks:
1. Regulatory compliance - Meeting industry standards
2. Reputation damage - From biased or incorrect predictions
3. Financial losses - From poor model decisions
4. Operational disruption - System downtime or failures

Risk mitigation strategies:
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- Regular model retraining and updates
- Access controls and audit trails
- Incident response procedures

The three lines of defense model applies to ML:
- First line: Model developers and data scientists
- Second line: Model risk management team
- Third line: Internal audit and compliance
