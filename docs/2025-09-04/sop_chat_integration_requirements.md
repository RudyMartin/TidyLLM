# SOP Golden Answers Chat Integration Requirements

## üéØ **MISSING COMPONENTS IDENTIFIED**

Based on your description and examining the existing workflow, here's what's missing and needs to be built:

---

## üìö **1. SOP Golden Answers - Primary Domain RAG**

### **Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Found evidence: `golden_answers_kb/golden_answer_1756923453.json` exists
- ‚úÖ Basic domain RAG mentioned in workflow: `load_domain_rag` operation 
- ‚ùå **MISSING**: SOP-specific golden answers RAG that takes precedence

### **What Needs to Be Built:**
```yaml
# Enhanced workflow operation needed:
- name: "load_sop_golden_answers"
  gateway: "heiros"
  instruction: "Load SOP Golden Answers domain RAG with precedence over general domain knowledge"
  priority: "highest"
  sop_compliance: "required"
  
- name: "validate_against_sop"
  gateway: "heiros" 
  instruction: "Validate MVR analysis against SOP standards and procedures"
  depends_on: ["load_sop_golden_answers"]
```

**Implementation Required:**
- **SOP Domain RAG Builder**: Script to create SOP-specific knowledge base
- **Precedence Logic**: Ensure SOP answers override general domain knowledge
- **Compliance Validation**: Check MVR analysis against SOP standards

---

## üìã **2. Checklist Integration (Markdown)**

### **Current State:**
- ‚ùå **MISSING**: No checklist integration in current workflow
- ‚ùå **MISSING**: No markdown checklist storage/retrieval system

### **What Needs to Be Built:**
```yaml
# New workflow operations needed:
- name: "load_mvr_checklists"
  gateway: "heiros"
  instruction: "Load relevant MVR analysis checklists from markdown repository"
  checklist_types: ["initial_classification", "qa_comparison", "peer_review", "final_report"]
  
- name: "execute_checklist_validation"
  gateway: "llm"
  instruction: "Execute checklist items and mark completion status"
  depends_on: ["load_mvr_checklists"]
  output_format: "checklist_completion_report"
```

**Implementation Required:**
- **Checklist Repository**: Markdown file storage system for checklists
- **Checklist Execution Engine**: System to run through checklist items
- **Completion Tracking**: Mark which checklist items are satisfied
- **Integration Points**: Hook checklists into each workflow stage

---

## üí¨ **3. SOP Chat Interface - THE BIG MISSING PIECE**

### **Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Basic chat interface exists: `tidyllm/chat_workflow_interface.py`
- ‚úÖ MVR workflow integration exists
- ‚ùå **MISSING**: SOP-specific chat functionality
- ‚ùå **MISSING**: MVR vs VST comparison chat interface

### **What Needs to Be Built:**

#### **Enhanced Chat Interface Features:**
```python
# Additional UI components needed in chat interface:

class SOPChatInterface:
    """Chat interface specifically for SOP guidance during MVR analysis"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.sop_rag = load_sop_golden_answers()
        self.current_stage = None
        self.mvr_document = None
        self.vst_document = None
    
    def chat_with_sop(self, user_question: str, context: Dict):
        """Chat with SOP knowledge base during analysis"""
        # Query SOP golden answers with precedence
        # Return guidance specific to current workflow stage
        pass
    
    def compare_mvr_vs_vst_with_sop(self, mvr_section: str, vst_section: str):
        """Chat interface for comparing MVR against VST with SOP guidance"""
        # Interactive comparison with SOP standards
        # Real-time SOP compliance checking
        pass
    
    def get_stage_specific_sop_guidance(self, stage: str):
        """Get SOP guidance for specific workflow stage"""
        # Return relevant SOP guidance for current stage
        pass
```

#### **UI Integration Required:**
```python
# Enhanced chat interface layout needed:

col1, col2, col3 = st.columns([1, 2, 1])

with col1:
    st.header("üìã SOP Guidance")
    # SOP chat interface
    # Stage-specific guidance
    # Checklist progress
    
with col2: 
    st.header("üí¨ MVR Analysis Chat")
    # Main chat interface
    # Document upload
    # Analysis results
    
with col3:
    st.header("üìä MVR vs VST")
    # Document comparison view
    # Side-by-side comparison
    # SOP compliance indicators
```

## üîß **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: SOP Golden Answers Domain RAG (Critical)**
- [ ] **Build SOP Knowledge Base**: Create specialized SOP domain RAG
- [ ] **Precedence Logic**: Ensure SOP answers take priority
- [ ] **Workflow Integration**: Add SOP validation to mvr_analysis_flow.yaml

### **Phase 2: Checklist System (High Priority)**
- [ ] **Markdown Checklist Repository**: Create checklist storage system
- [ ] **Checklist Execution Engine**: Build system to run checklist items
- [ ] **Workflow Integration**: Add checklist operations to each stage

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Chat Interface (Essential)**
- [ ] **SOP Chat Component**: Build SOP-specific chat interface
- [ ] **MVR vs VST Comparison UI**: Side-by-side comparison with SOP guidance
- [ ] **Stage-Specific Guidance**: Context-aware SOP assistance

### **Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Required)**
- [ ] **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete SOP-guided workflow
- [ ] **Compliance Validation**: Ensure SOP compliance throughout
- [ ] **User Training**: Document SOP chat usage

## üö® **CRITICAL GAPS TO ADDRESS**

### **1. SOP Chat is NOT in Current Workflow**
The current `mvr_analysis_flow.yaml` has domain RAG, but **no SOP-specific chat interface** for interactive guidance during analysis.

### **2. MVR vs VST Comparison Needs Interactive Chat**
The workflow does comparison, but there's **no chat interface** for analysts to ask SOP-specific questions during the comparison process.

### **3. Checklist Integration is Completely Missing**
There's **no checklist system** in the current workflow - this is a major compliance gap.

---

## üí° **RECOMMENDATION**

**BUILD A NEW STREAMLIT DEMO**: `scripts/start_sop_mvr_chat_demo.py`

This would be a specialized demo that combines:
1. **SOP Chat Interface** - Interactive guidance from golden answers
2. **MVR vs VST Comparison** - Side-by-side with SOP compliance
3. **Checklist Integration** - Real-time checklist completion
4. **Workflow Monitoring** - Track progress through 4-stage cascade

**This is the missing UI component that connects SOP golden answers to the MVR analysis workflow!**

## üéØ **ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION**

> "Is that already in the workflow or is that through a UI we have to build?"

**ANSWER**: **We need to build the UI!**

- ‚úÖ **Workflow has**: Basic domain RAG loading
- ‚ùå **Workflow missing**: SOP-specific golden answers priority
- ‚ùå **Workflow missing**: Checklist integration  
- ‚ùå **UI missing**: SOP chat interface for MVR vs VST comparison
- ‚ùå **UI missing**: Interactive SOP guidance during analysis

**The SOP chat functionality for comparing MVR against VST is NOT in the current system and needs to be built as a new Streamlit interface.**
