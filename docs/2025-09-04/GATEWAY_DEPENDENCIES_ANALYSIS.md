# Gateway Dependencies Analysis

## Understanding the Dependency Chain

Based on your requirements, here's the dependency logic:

### 1. **DSPyGateway Dependencies**
```
DSPyGateway → requires → LLMGateway
```
**Why**: DSPy needs access to language models, and in corporate environments, that access should go through the controlled LLMGateway for governance.

### 2. **HeirOSGateway Dependencies** 
```
HeirOSGateway → requires → DSPyGateway + LLMGateway
```
**Why**: HeirOS optimizes workflows that often involve AI processing (DSPy) and need corporate controls (LLM).

### 3. **LLMGateway Dependencies**
```
LLMGateway → self-contained (no additional dependencies)
```
**Why**: LLMGateway is the foundational corporate control layer.

## Dependency Chain Visualization

```
LLMGateway (Foundation)
    ↑
    └── DSPyGateway (needs LLM access)
            ↑  
            └── HeirOSGateway (needs both DSPy + LLM)
```

## Configuration Changes Needed

### 1. **Gateway Base Configuration**
Each gateway needs:
- `use_dspy_gateway: bool`
- `use_llm_gateway: bool`  
- `use_heiros_gateway: bool`

### 2. **Automatic Dependency Resolution**
When a gateway is initialized, it should:
1. Check its dependencies
2. Auto-enable required gateways
3. Configure the dependency chain
4. Provide fallback/alternate options for safety

### 3. **Safety Placeholders**
For uncertain alternate states, we'll use the same gateway as a safe placeholder with clear comments.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Add dependency configuration to base gateway
### Step 2: Implement auto-enabling logic
### Step 3: Update each gateway with dependency rules
### Step 4: Add safety fallbacks and placeholders
