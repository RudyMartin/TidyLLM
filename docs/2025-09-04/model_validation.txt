Model Validation Best Practices

Model validation is a critical process in machine learning operations that ensures models perform reliably in production environments.

Key principles:
1. Independent validation data - Never use training data for validation
2. Statistical significance - Ensure sufficient sample sizes for robust testing
3. Business metric alignment - Validate against actual business outcomes
4. Temporal validation - Test model performance across different time periods
5. Segment analysis - Validate performance across different user segments

Validation techniques:
- Cross-validation for robust performance estimates
- Backtesting for time-series models
- A/B testing for production validation
- Shadow mode deployment for risk mitigation

Model monitoring should include:
- Performance drift detection
- Data drift monitoring
- Bias detection and mitigation
- Regulatory compliance tracking
