Data Governance for Machine Learning

Effective data governance is essential for successful ML implementations and regulatory compliance.

Data governance principles:
1. Data quality - Accurate, complete, and consistent data
2. Data lineage - Clear tracking of data sources and transformations
3. Data security - Protection against unauthorized access
4. Data privacy - Compliance with privacy regulations
5. Data retention - Appropriate storage and deletion policies

Governance framework components:
- Data stewardship roles and responsibilities
- Data classification and cataloging
- Access controls and permission management
- Data quality monitoring and validation
- Metadata management and documentation

ML-specific governance considerations:
- Training data provenance and bias assessment
- Model feature documentation and validation
- Prediction explainability and interpretability
- Model versioning and artifact management
- Performance monitoring and drift detection

Regulatory considerations:
- GDPR compliance for personal data
- Model fairness and bias prevention
- Algorithmic transparency requirements
- Right to explanation for automated decisions
- Data subject rights and consent management
