  3. S3MVRUploader â†’ tidyllm_compliance/mvr_analysis/s3_uploader.py

  âœ… Package Integration Complete:

  - New MVR analysis module added to tidyllm-compliance
  - Package imports updated - all classes available via from tidyllm_compliance import
  - Compliance validation integrated - YRSN + Evidence validation built-in
  - Professional packaging - enterprise-ready structure

  âœ… Your Client Now Gets:

  import tidyllm_compliance as tc

  # Complete regulatory compliance workflow
  processor = tc.S3FirstMVRProcessor(
      enable_yrsn_validation=True,      # Signal-to-noise analysis
      enable_evidence_validation=True   # Document authenticity
  )

  monitor = tc.S3MVRMonitor(
      enable_compliance_validation=True # Automatic quality control
  )

  uploader = tc.S3MVRUploader()        # Professional file upload

  âœ… Business Value Transformation:

  - Before: Scattered Python scripts in /scripts/
  - After: Professional tidyllm-compliance regulatory platform
