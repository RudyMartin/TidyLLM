COMPREHENSIVE REPORTING SYSTEM COMPLETE!

  Key Results Shown:

  1. Leading Questions Impact (Now Visible):

  - Leading Questions: 94.8% noise → "CRITICAL FAILURE"
  - Neutral Questions: 72.3% noise → "MODERATE RISK"
  - 22.5% difference just from how we ask!

  2. Two Report Types Created:

  Domain Report (Single Domain):
  - Shows all questions asked
  - Labels each as LEADING or NEUTRAL
  - Calculates aggregate YRSN scores
  - Key Finding: Leading questions artificially inflate noise by 22.5%

  Cross-Domain Report (Conflict Detection):
  - Compares guidance across checklist/SOP/modeling
  - Identifies conflicts (e.g., quarterly vs annual validation)
  - Shows resolution hierarchy (checklist > SOP > modeling)
  - Provides authoritative source for each conflict

  3. Plain English Summary:

  - The System Works - It's finding and processing documents
  - The Questions Matter - "What are..." assumes they exist (94.8% noise)
  - Better Questions - "Are there specific..." allows for "No" (72.3% noise)
  - Real Problem - Documents contain regulatory fluff, not specific guidance

  4. Next Steps for AIGateway/DSPy Integration:

  The infrastructure exists in tidyllm\domain_rag_workflow_builder.py and AIGateway files. Would need to connect the cross-domain reporter
   to send optimized queries through the gateway for multi-domain analysis.

  The disclaimer now clearly states: "Leading questions artificially increase noise scores because they force the system to find something
   even when specifics don't exist."
