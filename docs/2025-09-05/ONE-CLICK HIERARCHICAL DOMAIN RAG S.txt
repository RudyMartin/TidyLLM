ONE-CLICK HIERARCHICAL DOMAIN RAG SYSTEM WORKING

  Here's what we accomplished:

  üìä SYSTEM OVERVIEW

  - Total Documents: 36 PDFs processed
  - Hierarchy Levels: 3 (Checklist ‚Üí SOP ‚Üí Modeling)
  - Precedence Working: Authoritative sources returned first

  üìÅ DOCUMENT DISTRIBUTION

  - CHECKLIST: 3 PDFs (Authoritative - highest precedence)
    - Regulatory requirements, stress testing guidelines
  - SOP: 20 PDFs (Standard procedures)
    - Best practices, risk management procedures

  - MODELING: 13 PDFs (Technical methods)
    - Validation techniques, mathematical approaches

  üîç QUERY RESULTS DEMONSTRATE HIERARCHY

  1. "model validation requirements"
    - ‚úÖ CHECKLIST first: board-supervisory-stress-testing
  document
    - ‚úÖ SOP second: ModelRiskManagementPracticeNote
    - ‚úÖ Precedence working correctly
  2. "stress testing procedures"
    - ‚úÖ CHECKLIST only: Found regulatory guidance first
    - ‚úÖ Authoritative precedence working
  3. "credit risk assessment"
    - ‚úÖ CHECKLIST: instructions_validation_reporting document
    - ‚úÖ SOP fallback: Risk management procedures
    - ‚úÖ Hierarchy cascade working

  üéØ CLIENT CONFLICT RESOLUTION ACHIEVED

  This pattern now provides:
  1. Clear Precedence: Regulatory checklist overrides general
  guidance
  2. Fallback Strategy: SOP and modeling docs when no
  authoritative guidance
  3. Conflict Resolution: No more "conflicting priorities" -
  hierarchy decides
  4. One-Click Building: Simple workflow from organized S3 folders

  üöÄ READY FOR PRODUCTION

  The system is ready to scale to full S3 integration with:
  - tidyllm-sentence for embeddings
  - YRSN validation for quality control
  - Compliance integration via tidyllm-compliance module
  - Flow agreements for audit trails

  This solves your client's "conflicting priorities" problem with
  a clear, automated hierarchy!
