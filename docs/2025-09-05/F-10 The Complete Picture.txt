  The Complete Picture:

  Flow Agreement (Contract Layer)
      ↓ Defines what's allowed
  Bracket Parser (Execution Layer)
      ↓ Executes the workflow
  Gateway System (Processing Layer)
      ↓ Does the actual work
  Audit Trail (Compliance Layer)
      ↓ Records everything

● Summary: No Competition, Just Layers

  1. Flow Agreements (tidyllm/flow_agreements/) = Legal/compliance layer defining what's allowed
  2. Bracket Parser (tidyllm/s3_flow_parser.py) = Execution layer that runs workflows
  3. Demo Flow (tidyllm/demo-standalone/) = Simplified testing version

  For production audit work, use the production Flow Agreements for compliance contracts and the Bracket Parser for
  execution. They work together, not against each other.
