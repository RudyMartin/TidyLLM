● ✅ PROBLEM SOLVED! We now have TWO DISTINCT domainRAG SYSTEMS with clear naming:

  NAMING CONVENTION (No Confusion):

  1. External Domain RAG (knowledge_base/)

  - Purpose: Model validation compliance documents
  - Content: 25 PDFs (checklist/sop/modeling)
  - System: domain_rag_system/
  - S3-Connected: ✅

  2. TidyLLM Internal Domain RAG (docs/ + git-tracked)

  - Purpose: Self-referential conflict resolution for TidyLLM codebase
  - Content: 12 git-tracked documentation files (NOT ignored)
  - System: tidyllm_internal_domain_rag/
  - Hierarchy: CRITICAL > ARCHITECTURE > CURRENT > RECENT > HISTORICAL > EXAMPLES

  HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE:

  Precedence Levels:
  1. CRITICAL_DECISIONS (1.0) - Critical design decisions, constraints
  2. ARCHITECTURE (0.9) - System architecture, integration roadmaps
  3. CURRENT (0.8) - Latest docs (2025-09-05)
  4. RECENT (0.7) - Recent docs (2025-09-04, 2025-09-03)
  5. HISTORICAL (0.6) - Historical docs (2025-09-01)
  6. EXAMPLES (0.5) - Templates and examples

  CONFLICT RESOLUTION:

  - Code conflicts: Resolved by TidyLLM Internal domainRAG hierarchy
  - Documentation conflicts: Higher precedence level wins
  - Only git-tracked files: Excludes ignored/generated reports
  - Self-referential: TidyLLM can now answer questions about itself!

  Ready to resolve internal conflicts like:
  - "What is the official session management pattern?"
  - "Should we use UnifiedSessionManager or Gateway pattern?"
  - "Which embedding system is primary?"

  The system found 12 git-tracked docs and successfully built the internal domainRAG with conflict
  resolution capabilities!
