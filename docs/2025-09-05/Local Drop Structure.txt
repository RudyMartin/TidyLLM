 Local Drop Structure:
  knowledge_base/
  ├── checklist/  ← Drop-off for checklist PDFs
  ├── sop/        ← Drop-off for SOP PDFs
  └── modeling/   ← Drop-off for modeling PDFs

  S3 Target Structure:
  s3://nsc-mvp1/knowledge_base/
  ├── checklist/  ← Authoritative MRM checklists
  ├── sop/        ← Base SOP guidance
  └── modeling/   ← Base modeling documents

  Three Flow Agreements Created:
  1. ✅ flow_checklist_upload.py - Pushes checklist PDFs to S3
  2. ✅ flow_sop_upload.py - Pushes SOP PDFs to S3
  3. ✅ flow_modeling_upload.py - Pushes modeling PDFs to S3

  Usage:
  # After sorting PDFs into local folders
  python flow_checklist_upload.py
  python flow_sop_upload.py
  python flow_modeling_upload.py

  This follows the proven whitepapers pattern - local papers/
  folder was the drop-off, now we have three drop-offs matching
  our hierarchical domainRAG structure. Files will be ready in S3
  when we code the S3-first version!

  The hierarchical folder structure is now populated in S3, ready
  for the one-click S3-first domainRAG builder to create the
  precedence hierarchy:

  Authoritative (checklist) → Base (SOP + modeling) → YRSN
  validation
