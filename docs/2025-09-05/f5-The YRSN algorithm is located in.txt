  YRSN (Yes/Relevant/Specific/No-fluff) Algorithm Details ðŸŽ¯

  YRSN is a proprietary compliance validation algorithm that measures signal-to-noise ratio in guidance content:

  Core Algorithm Components:

  - Actionable Indicators Detection: Identifies specific guidance (use, must use, required, implement, configure)
  - Noise Indicators Detection: Penalizes vague language (may be, could be, unclear, depends on)
  - Quality Assessment Scoring: Calculates noise percentage and compliance risk levels
  - Compliance Validation: Pass/Fail determination based on actionable content ratio

  Algorithm Files:

  1. yrsn_analyzer.py - Core YRSN noise analysis implementation
  2. conflict_reporter.py - Integration with temporal conflict resolution
  3. fallback_strategy.py - Fallback guidance when YRSN scores are high

  Usage Throughout System:

  - 64 files reference YRSN validation across the codebase
  - Domain RAG builders use YRSN for quality control
  - Compliance reporting integrates YRSN metrics
  - SOP conflict resolution relies on YRSN scoring

  Key Metrics:

  - Noise Percentage: 0-100% (lower is better)
  - Actionable Content Ratio: Weighted measurement of specific guidance
  - Compliance Status: PASS (<50% noise) or FAIL (â‰¥50% noise)
  - Quality Assessment: CRITICAL/HIGH/MODERATE/ACCEPTABLE/EXCELLENT

  This is definitely a critical proprietary asset that should be safeguarded - it's the core algorithm for
  compliance validation across your entire TidyLLM system.
