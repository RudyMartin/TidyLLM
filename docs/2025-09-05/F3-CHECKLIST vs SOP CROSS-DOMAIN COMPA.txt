CHECKLIST vs SOP CROSS-DOMAIN COMPARISON RESULTS

  Key Findings:

  Document Inventory:
  - Checklists: 3 authoritative regulatory documents
  - SOPs: 14 operational procedure documents

  Topic-by-Topic Analysis:

  1. Model Validation Frequency
    - Checklist: "Quarterly validation required for high-risk models" (HIGH specificity)
    - SOP: "Validation frequency based on model complexity" (MEDIUM specificity)
    - No Conflict - SOP defers to checklist requirement
  2. Stress Testing Requirements
    - Checklist: "Annual stress testing with board oversight mandatory" (HIGH)
    - SOP: "Should align with business cycles" (LOW)
    - No Conflict - SOP is too vague to conflict
  3. Documentation Standards
    - Checklist: "Complete documentation per regulatory template" (MEDIUM)
    - SOP: "Should be comprehensive and accessible" (LOW)
    - No Conflict - SOP is generic guidance
  4. Risk Assessment Methods
    - Checklist: "Credit risk must follow Basel III framework" (HIGH)
    - SOP: "Methodologies vary by model type" (MEDIUM)
    - No Conflict - SOP doesn't contradict Basel III
  5. Performance Monitoring
    - Checklist: "Continuous monitoring with defined thresholds" (MEDIUM)
    - SOP: "Regular monitoring recommended" (LOW)
    - No Conflict - SOP is too general

  Summary Metrics:

  - Conflicts Found: 0/5 topics
  - Conflict Rate: 0%
  - Checklist Clarity: HIGH (specific requirements)
  - SOP Clarity: LOW (general guidance)

  The Real Issue:

  SOPs are too vague to conflict with checklists! The high YRSN noise scores (84-91% for SOPs vs 38-62% for checklists) show SOPs contain
  mostly generic guidance that doesn't contradict specific regulatory requirements.

  Recommendations:

  1. Improve SOP Specificity - SOPs need actionable steps, not platitudes
  2. Maintain Hierarchy - Checklist always wins when specific
  3. The problem isn't conflicts - it's that SOPs don't provide useful implementation guidance
