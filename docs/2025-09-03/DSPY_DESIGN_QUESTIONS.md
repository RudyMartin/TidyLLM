# DSPy Integration Design Questions
## Critical Architectural Decisions Required

Based on the analysis of competing implementations and integration depth, these design questions must be answered to create a coherent DSPy architecture.

---

## **1. COMPETING IMPLEMENTATIONS RESOLUTION**

### **Question 1.1: DSPy Wrapper Consolidation**
**Current State:** 4 competing DSPy implementations discovered
- `dspy_wrapper.py` (453 lines) - Basic wrapper
- `dspy_enhanced.py` (515 lines) - Most feature-complete
- `dspy_bedrock_enhanced.py` (461 lines) - Provider-specific
- `dspy_gateway_backend.py` (205 lines) - Gateway integration

**Design Questions:**
- [ ] **Which DSPy implementation should be canonical?**
  - Keep `dspy_enhanced.py` as primary (most features)?
  - Integrate provider-specific features from bedrock version?
  - Maintain separate implementations for different use cases?

- [ ] **How should provider-specific features be handled?**
  - Single wrapper with provider plugins?
  - Separate wrappers per provider?
  - Configuration-driven approach?

- [ ] **What happens to existing imports?**
  - Create compatibility aliases for migration period?
  - Force immediate migration to chosen implementation?
  - Deprecate gradually with warnings?

### **Question 1.2: Gateway Integration Strategy** 
**Current State:** Multiple gateway implementations
- Internal `tidyllm/gateway/` directory
- Standalone `tidyllm-gateway` package  
- `gateway_simple.py` file (559 lines)

**Design Questions:**
- [ ] **Which gateway implementation should be primary?**
  - Keep standalone package as canonical?
