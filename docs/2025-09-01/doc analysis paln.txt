  ⎿  Advanced RAG Analysis System for Model Development Plans

     EASY WINS (3-5 implementation cycles)

     1. TOC Analysis Engine - Extract table of contents to instantly map development scope/scale
     2. Bibliography Network Mapping - Parse references to create citation clusters and identify key foundational papers
     3. Signal-to-Noise Ratio Calculator - Measure content density (technical terms vs filler) to assess author rigor
     4. Section Length Analysis - Identify where authors spend most effort (methodology vs results vs discussion)
     5. Keyword Density Heatmaps - Track concept evolution through document sections

     MEDIUM COMPLEXITY (5-10 cycles)

     1. Cross-Reference Validation - Find claims that cite supporting evidence vs unsupported assertions
     2. Methodology Extraction Pipeline - Auto-identify and categorize experimental approaches/validation methods
     3. Figure/Table Content Analysis - OCR and analyze visual elements for data patterns
     4. Author Collaboration Networks - Map co-authorship patterns across the corpus
     5. Temporal Trend Analysis - Track how research approaches evolve over publication dates

     LONG-TERM ADVANCED (10+ cycles)

     1. Semantic Dependency Graphs - Build knowledge graphs showing concept relationships across papers
     2. Model Architecture Comparison Engine - Extract and compare technical specifications automatically
     3. Validation Plan Completeness Scorer - Assess how thoroughly papers address validation requirements
     4. Evidence Quality Ranking - Score supporting evidence strength using multi-factor analysis
     5. Research Gap Identifier - Find unexplored areas by analyzing what's missing from citation networks

     Core Strategy: Build on existing RAG infrastructure, add specialized analysis modules that can attach to any corpus later.
